// Internal link shim — do NOT import this from consumer code.
//
// MaestroKitParamount ships as a prebuilt binary xcframework whose source
// imports RiveRuntime. A binary target cannot declare its own package
// dependencies, so the consumer's package graph would have no RiveRuntime to
// resolve or link against — `swift build` fails with "unable to resolve module
// dependency: 'RiveRuntime'".
//
// This tiny source target carries the RiveRuntime dependency (see the package
// manifest). Because it is a member of the shipped library product, RiveRuntime
// resolves and links into the consuming app automatically — no changes to the
// client's own integration or code.
